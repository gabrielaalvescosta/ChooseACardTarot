This is a very simple tarot game made with pure JavaScript, CSS and HTML. It's a game with 3 cards, which you can choose only one of then clicking on it. You can see your answer when you click on your card and open a modal with a card and the answer of your question. All time you click on "play again", the script randomize a new card.
